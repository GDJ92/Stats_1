"A point estimate is a single value (or point) that serves as an estimate or guess for a population parameter based on sample data. It is used to approximate or infer the true value of a population parameter when it is impractical or impossible to measure the entire population.

For example, if you conduct a survey of 500 people to estimate the average age of all adults in a city, the sample mean age of the 500 surveyed individuals would be a point estimate for the population mean age.

On the other hand, the parameter of interest is the specific population characteristic or value that we want to estimate or make inferences about based on the sample data. It's the true, fixed value that we seek to understand or describe about the entire population.

Continuing with the previous example, the parameter of interest would be the actual average age of all adults in the city, not just the estimate based on the sample. It's what we aim to learn about through our study or survey.

In summary, the point estimate is the estimated value derived from the sample data, while the parameter of interest is the true, unknown value about the population that we're trying to estimate or understand.","Explain the difference between a Type I error and a Type II error in hypothesis testing.
